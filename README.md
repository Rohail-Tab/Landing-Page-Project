# Landing-Page-Project

This is my second project on The Odin Project.

I made a website from a website picture provided by The Odin Project.

There is an html, css and README file.

There are four sections and a footer on this webpage.
I used flexbox a lot for positioning.

There is an issue in .first-section that i am not able to figure out. Try zooming in and out and you will notice the issue. The left-side element and right-side elements start growing apart.
 If you have any suggustions, tell me.

 All other sections work properly.

 Overall, it was a good and fun project.

Keep Learning ! Rohail Tabassum.
